# Briefing Report On Pilot Angels Project

> Name/Uid



## Abstract

This report is an appraisal of the Pilot Angels project developed by Soft Support. A short summary of the project background will be discussed in the introduction section.



## Introduction

Pilot Angels project is a volunteer service for helping people with health care problems and need to travel to receive diagnosis or treatments. It is managed by a company called Husky Air specialized at aviation services for both business and private uses. The project works with health care providers, like hospitals, health care agencies, and organ banks, and volunteer pilots who are giving their time and aircraft to help people in need. People who needs a flight will contact Husky Air, then their requests will be matched to an available pilot to finish the job. Previously, this process was done mostly by operators through phone calls and all relevant data were stored in file folders. To streamline the whole process, Husky Air asked Soft Support to develop a bespoke software system to help increase the service quality as well as the efficiency for delivering the service. 

​	Soft Support has developed this project for 13 months. The team is lead by a project manager with extensive experiences on software development. Other team members include two experienced developers and three IT staff from Soft Support. The CEO of Husky Air has some concerns about the current project progress and hired a project manager to act as an independent third party whose mission is to audit the project. The following section will present a detailed appraisal of the project and how concerns of CEO's concerns can be sorted out. At last, there are some recommendations for the CEO.



## Discussion

The appraisal consists of three parts. They are the assessment of the quality of products and services, assessment of the project management, issues raised during the project development and potential risks.



### Quality of Project Planning and Services Delivered

​	According to the roadmap, there are three planned releases. First two releases have been completed and the last one has been delayed by three months. The ultimate goal of the project planning is to have 1.5 phone calls to finish one flight match on average. The planning in the roadmap covers features for people working at Husky Air, such as schedulers, risk managers, and safety managers, etc. However, not all stakeholders are considered in this planning. For example, pilots are only able to review the whole process through the new system, but not being able to make any changes to their information, such as availability. Pilots are not being able to make a flight request actively. The system is designed that pilots can only accept a flight request passively. Similarly, the planning lacks attention to patients or health care providers in the roadmap. This is a major planning drawback.

​	As for the product and services already shipped during the first two releases. Schedulers are allowed to check basic information of pilots and patient. The scheduler now only sees the pilots who are capable, but there is no information about pilot's availability. The functionality for checking pilot's availability is planned on a future release. This is an improvement as it doesn't require schedulers to manually check pilot's information  through file folders. However, to match a request, scheduler still need to actively check with pilot about their availability. Also, there are some information about patients still lacking in the current system. This is why the number of phone calls are not as low as the goal suggested. Because schedulers still need to make phone calls to checking all these missing information to successfully match a flight. Overall, the first two releases provides schedulers with the most basic features they need to match flights, and it improved the efficiency for schedulers' work.

​	Overall, the planned services are delivered on time and the quality meets the partial requirements. There are features need to be added to future releases to make all stakeholders satisfied.



### Quality of Project Management

First of all, the team applies Agile approaches in the development. It allows the team to response to changes faster than traditionally approaches. From the responses of the team members, Laissez-Faire leadership (Yang 2015) has been adopted by the team leader. Laissez-Faire leadership is best suited to teams where team members are highly self-motivated and understand the project goal clearly. In the case of the development team, it team members are diverged as only two of them are experienced developers. These two members are familiar with overall workflow in an Agile development team. Other team members are not sure about the whole process and still confused by some procedures. Also, there are complains about work ethics that not all members are making good contribution to the overall project. 

==[More inputs other than from leadership styles]==

​	Overall, the quality of project management can be improved in many ways and the not all team members are motivated. The team leader should have more communication with all of her team members and improve the team motivation.



### Issues and Risks

Apart from the planning issues and low motivation in the team, there are some other issues have been raised during the development. One major variation that might impact the whole project is the conversion from one FOSS software to another used during the development. According to the team manager, although this conversion is not a significant change to the plan, it will still require refactoring the code base and therefore further delay the product completion time. The team manager is planning to do a prototype which would take for about a month. The cost for delivering the final product will potentially increase if the conversion is failed or delayed further.
